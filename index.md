## Game Description
Play a fantasy character and try to complete all levels in the world of mazes.

Exiting from the maze won't be so easy...

To exit the maze you have to find two magic keys "Purple" and "Green" for the exit door to open.

On your path you will encounter enemies which will try to stop you. Those monsters guarding the keys and different paths within the maze. With each level the monsters become harder to defeat.

To defeat those monsters you will have to increase you character skills. To do that you have to collect gold to increase your character level. Become stronger and faster to overcome your enemies.

The mazes are randomly generated, so each game will preserve different challenges.
